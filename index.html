            Hi I am Dennis and I am currently in pursuit to becoming a Front-end Developer. I began my coding journey back in July 2019, I had decided not to go back to school at the University of Minnesota because it was too expensive and picked up coding in my free time. It quickly led to be buying multiple online courses and spending late nights trying to learn as much as I can so I could hopefully one day become a Front-end Developer.
           I currently live in Minnesota and I am looking for remote work as it would be the best fit for me currently. I am a hard worker who is strict on following my deadlines even if it means staying up until I complete a task. I am not afraid to admit when I am unsure of something as I am still learning, and not afraid to admit I am wrong.
           As of right now I would say I have an intermediate understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and I am currently learning React before I move onto some backend work as I hope to become a fully stacked developer in the future.

        </p>
        <p class="col-12 my-3">
            My interest in coding started when I was in high school and I took a computer repair co-op and an aerospace engineering course that both used coding. In my computer repair co-op after becoming certified as a technician on computer hardware our teacher started teaching us a bit about Java. This laid a foundation for the fundamentals of the smaller coding language we used in Aerospace Engineering as far as variables, loops, arrays, objs etc. After high school I wanted to pursue a career in computer hardware engineering and was attending the University of Minnesota to do so before
           costs started adding up. After I dropped out I wanted to push myself to become successful and remembered my fascination in coding when learning basic Java. I started taking an online Java course, and after more research and a lot of decisions I decided that starting with the front-end was a better fit for me as I am more of a visual person and enjoy that aspect of the front-end.
           for the past few months I have been pushing myself to code daily or at least learn something code related daily when I have the time and here we are today. I hope that I can be of value to your team in any way shape or form and hope to start getting real world experience so I can one day reach my goal of becoming a fully stacked developer.

        </p>
